# üìù Music Studio Web  
Music Studio is a streaming web interface connected to a blockchain app. Using the application developed in Next.js, it is possible to view, edit, create and delete streaming content, such as songs, artists, albums and playlists.

## üí° Learnings and improvements

In general, the project brought a lot of lessons, especially in terms of creating components and managing all the CRUDs in cases where one piece of information depends on the existence of another. Although I believe the result has been satisfactory, it is still possible to make several improvements, such as:

- Improving dependencies between CRUD functions;
- Optimized rendering of components;
- Refactoring the data creation functions;
